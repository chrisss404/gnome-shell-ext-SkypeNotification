### FAQs

#### How can I find debug/error output?

- `Alt`+`F2`, `lg`, `Enter`, navigate to `Extensions` tab and find `Show errors`
-  and / or `journalctl -xn -f /usr/bin/gnome-shell`

#### How can I enable and disable individual notifications?

Go to Options > Notifications and click on `Advanced View`. If the option `Execute the following script` is checked, the notification is enabled otherwise it is disabled ([initial question](https://github.com/chrisss404/gnome-shell-ext-SkypeNotification/issues/9)). [Here](https://github.com/chrisss404/gnome-shell-ext-SkypeNotification/blob/master/SkypeNotification%40chrisss404.gmail.com/skypeConfig.js#L45) is a list of all supported notifications.


#### Top bar menu icon shows, but I get no notifications, what can I do?

Make sure that you have installed Python D-Bus bindings. You can check by executing `python ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/SkypeNotification@chrisss404.gmail.com/notify.py -e"ChatIncoming" -n"Test" -f"%fname" -p"%fpath" -m"hello" -s"%fsize" -u"%sskype"`.


#### Can't install anymore after recent update, what shall I do?

Completely remove the extension by executing (`rm -rf ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/SkypeNotification@chrisss404.gmail.com`), restart GNOME Shell (`Alt`+`F2`, `r`, `Enter`) and reinstall it ([initial question](https://github.com/chrisss404/gnome-shell-ext-SkypeNotification/issues/17)).

### Known Issues

#### Group chats are missing

Most group chats are invisible, as they are not supported by the very outdated API. For more information see ([luord's comment](https://github.com/chrisss404/gnome-shell-ext-SkypeNotification/issues/69)).
